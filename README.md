# deep-learning
Notebook for learning deep learning

# 20 Days Goal
- Learn concepts involved in Deep Learning
- Try multiple classification and recognition problems
- Use tf, keras
- Learn Models, Layers, Convolution, Normalization, Pooling, etc.
- Learn mathematical concepts used in these layers.

# Day1:
- Tried image classification example

# Day2:
- Saw video on Types of layers of keras. Convolution, Pooling, Normalization and 
- Tried Text classification.

# Day3:
- Reading about relu, CNN and other concepts
- Understanding keras.layers.Dense: CNN layer op = activation(in, kernel) + bias
  - Units: size of output
  - Activation: function to apply linear or non-linear
  - Initializer: kernel and bias initial values.
- All keras layers: https://keras.io/layers/core/ I will focus on only some of them: Dense, Flatten, Dropouts

# Next Day Plan:
- Take other example
- Create script to try combinaations of units and activation functions. tabular result of each ones accuracy.
- Understand What happens when we apply keras layer.
